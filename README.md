I liked the new version of steamVR 2 which made teleport very easy and effortless .
iI didnt like that there is no much reference for STeamVR 2 , which made me take long time before i figuerout how the stuff work.
 
Rube Goldberg Game game take 3 weeks to complete, 

I have used Acer Windows mixed reality during development stage as it's much easyer for testing (no need to keep worry about setup sensories ) while game tested & realsed using Oculus rift.
